# Grapheel IRIS client API

Exciting name, huh?

This bit of javascript is the glue which connects the pretty front-end of IRIS to the back-end. It's pretty straightforward, just a way of sending off requests and interpreting the results into usable things.

The most important part of this is really the tests. Ideally every possible API call (inlcuding a handful of *"impossible"* ones) would be faked and accounted for.

## Contributing

Please only contribute if you are a member of the IRIS dev team, though issue raising and suggestions are more than welcome!

To run tests on code, simply use `yarn test`. Yes we use yarn and so should you (Turbo's cool too). npm is **sooo** 2015.

Over and out ðŸš€
