# Grapheel IRIS client API

Exciting name, huh?

This bit of javascript is the glue which connects the pretty front-end of IRIS to the back-end. It's pretty straightforward, just a way of sending off requests and interpreting the results into usable things.

The most important part of this is really the tests. Ideally every possible API call (inlcuding a handful of *"impossible"* ones) would be faked and accounted for.
